# TransformChild

If you already have a designated scripts folder, drag both scripts from the "Scripts" folder and place
them in there.

To apply the Rotation script onto an object, simply enter the "Scripts" folder and drag the script
called "Rotation" onto the object of your choice. 

To create a parent/child relationship between two objects, enter the "Scripts" folder and drag the
script called "TransformChild" onto the object that is supposed to be the child. Then, click on
the child object in the hierarchy and scroll down to the new "TransformChild" component in the inspector window.
Now, drag the parent object from the hierarchy, and place it in the slot called "Parent". 

To learn a bit more about how to use these scripts, watch the tutorial video at:
